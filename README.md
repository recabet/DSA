## Introduction

This repository serves as a collection of C implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms. It aims to provide clear and efficient implementations for learning and practical usage in projects.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- **hash**: Hash table data structure and related algorithms.
- **stack**: Stack data structure and related algorithms.
- **queue**: Queue data structure and related algorithms.
- **sort**: Sorting algorithms.
- **sll**: Single linked list (SLL) data structure and related algorithms.
- **dll**: Double linked list (DLL) data structure and related algorithms.

Each folder contains implementations of specific data structures or algorithms with appropriate header files (`*.h`) and source files (`*.c`).

## Installation

To use any of the data structures or algorithms in this repository:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/recabet/DSA.git

2. Navigate to the desired folder (e.g., `hash`, `stack`, etc.): cd <folder_name>

3. Compile the source files (assuming you have `gcc` installed): gcc -o main.c <lib_name>.c main

4. Run the executable: ./main

## Usage

Each folder contains its own set of data structures or algorithms. To use a specific implementation:

- Navigate to the corresponding folder (e.g., `hash` for hash table).
- Compile the files and run the executable as per the instructions provided in the `README.md` file within each folder.

## Contributing
